Exploring my favorite challenges from the month-long Huntress 2023 CTF event: insights and walkthrough.

---

## Introduction
In October 2023, Huntress ran a month-long CTF to celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The competition ran from October 2, 12:00 PM ET - October 31, 11:59 PM ET, with new challenges released every day.

I solved a total of 57 challenges over the course of this CTF, here are the write-ups for my favorite challenges that I encountered during the event!

## Challenges - Warmups
### Comprezz
> **Challenge**: Someone stole my S's and replaced them with Z's! Have you ever seen this kind of file before?<br/>
> **Attachments**: comprezz

Let's start by figuring out the file type of the attached file using the [`file`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html) command:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~/Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">file</span> <strong>comprezz</strong> <br/>comprezz: compress'd data 16 bits</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

This shows that comprezz is a UNIX-compressed file – and probably should have extension .z. Adding the correct extension will allow us to decompress this file and see what's inside.

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~/Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">mv</span> <strong>comprezz</strong> comprezz.z<br/><span class="t-teal"><br/>┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~/Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">uncompress</span> <strong>comprezz.z</strong><br/><span class="t-teal"><br/>┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~/Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">file</span> <strong>comprezz</strong><br/>comprezz: ASCII text<br/><span class="t-teal"><br/>┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~/Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">cat</span> <strong>comprezz</strong><br/>flag{196a71490b7b55c42bf443274f9ff42b}</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

### Baking
> **Challenge**: Do you know how to make cookies? How about HTTP flavored?

This challenge gives you a URL to a web application for a virtual oven.
There are several different buttons you can click to cook things in the oven, pressing one will start a timer countdown, for example cooking Muffins takes 15 minutes.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-baking.png" alt="A web application showing a stove with a 15 minute timer, there is text above it that says 'Your Muffins are in the oven!'">

When you choose Muffins a cookie named in_oven is set in your browser with the following value:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre><code>eyJyZWNpcGUiOiAiTXVmZmlucyIsICJ0aW1lIjogIjEwLzE0LzIwMjMsIDE0OjMwOjAwIn0=</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

This is a Base64 encoded string, when decoded becomes:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"recipe"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Muffins"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"time"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"10/14/2023, 14:30:00"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span></pre>
    </div>
</div>

The flag seems like it might be linked in the Magic Cookies object, which has a very long cook time of 7200 minutes to complete. Let's try to get these cookies baked without actually waiting all that time.

We do this by putting `Magic Cookies` into the oven and manipulating its browser's cookie and changing the date to one further than 7200 minutes in the past.

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre>Cookie:  eyJyZWNpcGUiOiAiTWFnaWMgQ29va2llcyIsICJ0aW1lIjogIjEwLzE0LzIwMjMsIDE0OjM1OjAwIn0=<br/>Decoded: <span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"recipe"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Magic Cookies"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"time"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"10/14/2023, 14:35:00"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span><br/><br/>Forgery: <span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"recipe"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Magic Cookies"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"time"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"1/1/1970, 00:00:00"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span><br/>Encoded: eyJyZWNpcGUiOiAiTWFnaWMgQ29va2llcyIsICJ0aW1lIjogIjEvMS8xOTcwLCAwMDowMDowMCJ9</pre>
    </div>
</div>

After changing our Browser's cookies (Chrome: Developer Tools > Application > Cookies) and refreshing the page, we can see this message:

Your <strong>Magic Cookies</strong> are done! Be careful they are hot! Congratulations <strong>flag{c36fb6ebdbc2c44e6198bf4154d94ed4}</strong>


### Dialtone
> **Challenge**: Well would you listen to those notes, that must be some long phone number or something!<br/>
> **Attachments**: dialtone.wav

This challenge was solved by my fellow teammate, Toaste.

Look forward to a write-up from them soon!

## Challenges - Forensics
### **Dumpster Fire**
> **Challenge**: We found all this data in the dumpster! Can you find anything interesting in here, like any cool passwords or anything? Check it out quick before the foxes get to it!<br/>
> **Attachments**: dumpster_fire.tar.xz

This challenge provides us with a 16MB archive file containing directories typical of a Linux/Unix environment. The challenge introduces the task of finding a password, with hints suggesting a connection to Firefox.

Let's look through the files for potential files stored in Firefox directories.  

<div class="language-console">

</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

Searching for more information about Firefox's password storage online, I discovered that the crucial password files are typically named **logins.json**, along with **key3.db** or **key4.db** for versions 58 and above.

I navigated into my own Firefox folder, located at   `/home/user/.mozilla/firefox/b33f.default-release`.
After making a backup of my own **logins.json** and **key4.db** files, I replaced them with the ones from the challenge's folder:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>/</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">cd</span> <strong>/home/user/.mozilla/firefox/b33f.default-esr/</strong>

    </div>
</div>

After restarting Firefox, and navigating to Menu > Passwords, we discovered login credentials containing the flag! `flag{35446041dc161cf5c9c325a3d28af3e3}`

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-dumpster-fire.png" alt="A blank Firefox profile containing the challenge's flag within the password manager.">

### Bad Memory
> **Challenge**: A user came to us and said they forgot their password. Can you recover it? The flag is the MD5 hash of the recovered password wrapped in the proper flag format.<br/>
> **Attachments**: image.zip (>600MB)

In the 'Bad Memory' challenge, we are given the task of extracting a password from a Windows Memory Dump, totaling 4.8GB in size. We will use [`Volatility 3`](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3), a free memory forensics tool developed and maintained by Volatility Foundation, which is commonly used to analyzing memory dumps.

Downloading Volatility 3 and running the help (-h) command, we can see a lot of plugins that would help in investigating further. The example below shows a few of these plugins.

<div class="language-console">

    </div>
</div>

Though there are a lot of useful plugins installed here, however the one that we need, windows.hashdump.Hashdump, doesn't seem to be apppearing on the list.
Navigating to `volatility3/volatility3/framework/plugins/windows`, there exists a `hashdump.py` plugin that we need to use.

Running this Python file, it appears that an error was caused due to the script using a deprecated library:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>/</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">python3</span> clone hashdump.py<br/>Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>  File "/home/user/Downloads/volatility3/volatility3/framework/plugins/windows/hashdump.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>    from Crypto.Cipher import AES, ARC4, DES<br/>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto'</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

Researching this issue online, it seems like it many people suggested using the 'pycryptodome' library instead of 'crypto'.
This is an easy fix, as all we need to do is type `pip install pycryptodome` to get the plugin working correctly.

</div>

We are able to crack the NT hash of `congo`'s account using an online tool ([crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/)), and view their plaintext password, `goldfish#`.

The challenge said that "The flag is the MD5 hash of the recovered password wrapped in the proper flag format."

## Challenges - Malware
### PHP Stager
> **Challenge**: Ugh, we found PHP set up as an autorun to stage some other weird shady stuff. Can you unravel the payload?<br/>
> **Attachments**: phonetic

The 'PHP Stager' challenge tasks us with working through obfuscated code. I've created a video guide for this one, check it out below or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhfwe7FPGh4)!

<div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0; padding-bottom:75%;">

### Batchfuscation
> **Challenge**: I was reading a report on past Trickbot malware, and I found this sample that looks a lot like their code! Can you make any sense of it?<br/>
> **Attachments**: batchfuscation

'Batchfuscation' provides us with an obfuscated Windows Batch script that we will need to break down to figure out what it does.

    </div>
</div>

Batch scripts use '%' signs to indicate variables. Variables are defined using the set command `set message=Hello World` and then can be referenced elsewhere `%message%`.

Knowing how variables are set and referenced, we can take a look at the first lines again after making substitutions:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Batch"></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>@echo <span class="t-lightblue">off</span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">bdevq</span>=<span class="t-highlight">set</span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">grfxdh</span>=<span class="t-highlight"> </span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">mbbzmk</span>=<span class="t-highlight">=</span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">xeegh</span>=<span class="t-highlight">/</span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">jeuudks</span>=<span class="t-highlight">a</span>
<span class="t-blue">set</span> <span class="t-gold">rbiky</span>=<span class="t-highlight">c</span></code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

Now we can see that the beginning of this Batch script is creating variables for each ASCII character that are being used to obfuscate the rest of the code.

Instead of manually replacing each variable in this file, let's have Batch do it for us! By changing the first line of the script to `@echo on` and running it, we should be able to see some readable output.

`C:\Users\win10\Desktop>batchfuscation.bat > batch.txt`

This method worked for deriving all of the `set` variables in the beginning of the file:

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-batchfuscation1.png" alt="An image of the batch script running besides a notepad file containing the set variables.">

This method didn't work for deobfuscating the rest of the code. One of my teammates suggested searching for keywords within the Batch script.

Using the dictionary, `flag` is represented in the script as `%vdqvoyxss%%djkxbuskp%%jeuudks%%mljmage%` and can be found on 41 different lines.

We can copy these 41 lines into a new Batch script to decipher. By including the `set` variables at the top, and the "flag" lines at the bottom with an `echo` command them, we can run the script to decipher each of these lines:

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-batchfuscation2.png" alt="An image of a batch script running besides a notepad file containing the set variables and echo commands.">

It looks like we found the flag! We are left with a bunch of lines like this:

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>::setflag_character5={<br/>::setflag_character26=3<br/>::setflag_character3=a</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

After cutting off the `::setflag_character` text and sorting the lines numerically, we are left with our flag: `flag{acad67e3d0b5bf31ac6639360db9d19a}`


### Speakfriend
> **Challenge**: It seems like this website was compromised. We found this file that seems to be related... can you make any sense of these and uncover a flag?<br/>
> **Attachments**: main.7z

'Speakfriend' provides us with a URL to a backdoored website, and a related malware file, `main`, stored within main.7z.

<div class="language-console">

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-speakfriend.png" alt="A webpage for a cyber security company that was recently breached.">

Trying to run this ELF binary does not produce any output. Let's try figuring out how this program works through Static Analysis.

Opening the program in [`Ghidra`](https://ghidra-sre.org/), we are able to determine a few things:
- The starting point for the file is a function called `main`, which takes in two paramaters. 

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-speakfriend1.png" alt="The main function has been decompiled in Ghidra, the line has the code: main(int param_1, long param_2)">

- There are a lot of [`curl`](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) api calls, meaning the script is reaching out to a website.
- Depending on what param_1 is, a new variable might get set with a value of "443", which would coincide with an HTTPS connection.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-speakfriend2.png" alt="Code decompiled in Ghidra, the word 'curl' has been highlighted multiple times, as well as the variable numbered '443'.">

- This script has a **hidden reversed string** hardcoded into it! It can be easy to miss since Ghidra only shows you its contents if you hover over it.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-speakfriend3.png" alt="A code snippet taken from Ghidra that shows a hidden user agent, starting with the word 'Mozilla'">

This hidden string appears to be a user agent, a string included in HTTP headers to identify the device requesting online content. If this script is reaching out to the website using curl and a custom user agent, we should be able to do this too.

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>

    <div class="highlight">

If not, click the link</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

By visiting the compromised website using the custom user agent, we are redirected to a suspicious subdomain that appears to be a command-and-control (c2) server!

When we access this suspicious webpage, we are greeted with our flag: `flag{3f2567475c6def39501bab2865aeba60}`

### Snake Eater II
> **Challenge**: <u>Snake Eater II - Revenge of the Snake Eater</u>
>
>The Threat Actor must have gotten word that you had no trouble dissecting Snake Eater. They said this one is a bit more... involved. <br/>
> **Attachments**: snake_eaterII.7z

HuskyHacks was responsible for making the three challenges that I found to be the most difficult during this CTF - Crab Rave, BlackCat II, and Snake Eater II. The first two absolutely stumped me, so I suggest [HuskyHack's walkthrough videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQzmX39vUc8&list=PLta338B2b1DXCbwzGzG5XkEQAaZhlwtbJ&index=5) if you'd like to know more about them.

As for the 'Snake Eater II' challenge, we are provided the malicious `snake_eaterII.exe` stored within a .7z archive.

Static analysis of the file shows that it was packed with **pyinstaller** (Python 3.11). 

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">diec</span> snake_eaterII.exe<br/>PE64<br/>Packer: PyInstaller(-)[-]<br/>Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(2022+)[-]<br/>Linker: Microsoft Linker(14.35**)[Console64,console]</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

We can also use dynamic analysis to learn more about what `snake_eaterII.exe` is doing. Since this is an .exe, we can run the file on a Windows VM and use [`Sysinternals - Process Monitor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to monitor if any changes are made to our file system in real-time.

**In the first Snake Eater challenge**, a text file containing the flag in its filename was being written to a random folder in our Windows %AppData% folder:

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-snake-eater.png" alt="A screenshot of Process Monitor showing the first Snake Eater challenge, here snake_eater.exe has created a file with the flag in it's filename.">

This challenge is very similar, however the flag is now stored within the text file, rather than in the filename - and it is overwritten and deleted instantly after it is created.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-snake-eaterII.png" alt="A screenshot of Process Monitor with the current Snake Eater II challenge, the same operations occured but the file is named flag.txt.">

I attempted a few things:
- Creating folder Auditing Security settings to log whenever a new file is modified or written within the %AppData% folder. This did not work because the actual contents of the file are not logged.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-snake-eaterII1.png" alt="Windows NTFS settings showing how to set auditing permissions to log changes to a folder.">

- Going through the assembly code line-by-line in debugger in [`x64dbg`](https://x64dbg.com/) to be able to view the contents of the file before it is deleted. This did not work because at some point, a new process is created by the .exe. Going through this sub-process line-by-line eventually leads to one single command that when executed creates and destroyes the file at the exact same time. 

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-snake-eaterII2.png" alt="A before-and-after picture showing how snake_eaterII.exe creates all of its processes instantaneously.">

- Eventually I found a tool called [`SysAnalyzer`](https://research.securitum.com/automatic-analysis-of-malicious-software-using-of-sysanalyzer/) that was capable of viewing the contents of .txt file (after a few attempts). Using the 'Directory Watcher', the tool was able to show any changes made to files within a directory.

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-snake-eaterII3.png" alt="A SysAnalyzer window open showing flag.txt's contents.">

My solution may have had some luck involved in it, but we were still able to get the flag! `flag{be47387ab77251ecf80db1b6725dd7ac}`

## Challenges - Miscellaneous
### M Three Sixty Five
> **Challenge**: This is the challenge portal with  separate deployable container environment for 4 separate "M Three Sixty Five" challenges.

This challenge allowed participants to connect to an actual Office 365 tenant running the AADInternals PowerShell module. AADInternals is widely used for administering Azure Active Directory (AD) and Office 365, however it also has a lot of features that can be leveraged by threat actors for malicious purposes like creating backdoor users, stealing passwords, and stealing encryption keys.

Most of this challenge just comes down to reading the [`AADInternals documentation`](https://aadinternals.com/aadinternals/), however it was an incredible experience learning about just how powerful this tool could be from both a blue team or red team perspective.

- Challenge 1 - Can you find any juicy details, like perhaps the <u>street address</u> this organization is associated with? 
  - `Get-AADIntTenantDetails | select street`
- Challenge 2 - This tenant looks to have some odd [Conditional Access Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview). Can you find a weird one? 
  - `Get-AADIntConditionalAccessPolicies | select displayName`
- Challenge 3 - We observed saw some sensitive information being shared over a Microsoft Teams message! Can you track it down? 
  - `Get-AADIntTeamsMessages | select Content`
- Challenge 4 - 
One of the users in this environment seems to have unintentionally left some information in their account details. Can you track down The President? 
  - `Get-AADIntUsers | grep -i president`
  - `Get-AADIntUsers | where Title -eq 'President'`

### Indirect Payload
> **Challenge**: We saw this odd technique in a previous malware sample, where it would uncover it's next payload by... well, you'll see. 

The 'Indirect Payload' challenge provides you with a URL, which when opened in Firefox warned me "**This page isn't redirecting properly** - Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete."

Firefox is a little incorrect here since the request will complete *eventually*, there are just over two hundred **Status 302 (REDIRECT)** pages first:

<img src="/assets/img/huntress-ctf-indirect-payload.png" alt="BurpSuite window showing the sheer amount of redirect pages encountered when visiting the URL.">

Curious to see if there was any information stored within the HTML of these pages, first I made a list of all of the URLs, then I curled through the entire list.

<div class="language-console">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span data-label-text="Terminal"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span>
        <span></span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">wget</span> <span class="t-seagreen">-i --max-redirect</span> 200 chal.ctf:port <span class="t-blue">&gt;&gt;</span> urls.txt<br/><br/><span class="t-teal">┌──(</span><span class="t-blue">user㉿kali</span><span class="t-teal">)-[</span><strong>~Downloads</strong><span class="t-teal">]</span><span class="t-teal"><br/>└─</span><span class="t-blue">$</span> <span class="t-lightblue">curl</span> ... <span class="t-purple">$</span><span class="t-blue">(</span><span class="t-lightblue">cat</span> urls.txt<span class="t-blue">)</span><br/>character 0 of the payload is f<br/>character 1 of the payload is l<br/>character 2 of the payload is a<br/>character 3 of the payload is g<br/>character 4 of the payload is {<br/>character 5 of the payload is 4<br/>character 6 of the payload is 4<br/>character ...</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

The payload (flag) was separated, and had different embedded components across many different pages in the redirects! `flag{448c05ab3e3a7d68e3509eb85e87206f}`

## Conclusion
A huge shoutout to Huntress Labs, as well as Chris Cochran, Alex Kelly, Matt Kiely, and John Hammond for making Huntress CTF 2023 possible. It was an incredible learning opportunity that I look forward to next year! 🥳
